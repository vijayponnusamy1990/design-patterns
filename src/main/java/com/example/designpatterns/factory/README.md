# Factory Design Pattern

* Factory design pattern is one of the widely used creational design patterns.
* It is used when we have a super class and multiple sub classes, based on the input, we have to return instance for one of the sub classes.
Factory design pattern can be implemented using either Abstract classes or Interfaces.
